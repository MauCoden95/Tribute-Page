            Mario Alberto Kempes Chiodi is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a striker. His
            father, Mario, also a footballer, inspired him to play from a young age. He is also widely regarded as one
            of the greatest football players of all time. At the age of seven he began playing with a junior team and at
            fourteen, he joined the Talleres reserves. A prolific goalscorer, at club level he is best known for playing
            for Valencia, finishing as La Liga's top goalscorer twice, and amassing 116 goals in 184 league games for
            the club.

            At international level, Kempes was the focal point of Argentina's 1978 World Cup win where he scored twice
            in the final, and received the Golden Boot as top goalscorer. He also won the Golden Ball for the player of
            the tournament, making him one of only three players to have won all three awards at a single World Cup,
            along with Garrincha in 1962, and Paolo Rossi in 1982.
